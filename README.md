# Journalistic-platform
This project is a journalistic platform developed in C# for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The platform features three types of user roles: Admin, Journalist/Creator, and User/Reader, each with distinct capabilities to ensure smooth interaction and content management.

Admin: The admin has full control over the platform, including approving new journalists/creators and monitoring user activity.

Journalist/Creator: Journalists/creators can post news articles and share content, fostering engagement on the platform.

User/Reader: Users can engage by liking, commenting, writing reviews, and following their favorite creators.

The project incorporates efficient data structures to manage platform data, such as user profiles, articles, and comments. The backend leverages MySQL for data storage and retrieval, ensuring that user interactions, such as likes and comments, are efficiently handled. Key DSA concepts such as hashing, searching algorithms, and database indexing are implemented to optimize data access and processing speed.

Additional features include user profile pictures (PFPs) and user engagement tracking, allowing for a rich, interactive user experience. The platformâ€™s design emphasizes scalability and performance, ensuring that as the user base grows, the system can handle increased activity without compromising speed or reliability.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world context while providing a fully functional and engaging platform for content sharing.
